# GameCritter

This is Mr Marques GameCritter Project

So the File strucutre is kinda weird cuss mohsin did some
shit to it and IDK but it works so deal with it.

The code is in the file path GameCritter/src/com/efran/gridworld/

if you need the code and don't have git desktop app then download
the code as a ZIP but you won't be able to update the code in the git repository

Git is kinda confusing but learn how to use it and get it over with

Try to learn how to use Git so your life can a bit easier

Oh the schools computers don't have git or the newest IntelliJ so just remember that
